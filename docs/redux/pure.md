# Pure functions

## Pure = Not mixed

A function is pure, if it only operates on the arguments provided, and the only way for it to communicate with outside world is through the return value.

*-Wikipedia*

> In computer programming, a pure function is a function that has the following properties: Its return value is the same for the same arguments. Its evaluation has no side effects. Thus a pure function is a computational analogue of a mathematical function.

Or as [Eric Elliot says](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976)  
> A pure function is a function which:
> * Given the same input, will always return the same output.(idempotent)
> * Produces no side effects.
>
> A dead giveaway that a function is impure is if it makes sense to call it without using its return value. For pure functions, thatâ€™s a noop.

## Side Effects

Any interaction with anything outside the function is a Side Effect. It could either be a victim, or cause of it. Some examples are:

* Making an HTTP request
* Mutating data
* Printing to a screen or console
* DOM Query/Manipulation
* Math.random()
* Getting the current time
