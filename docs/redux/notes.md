# Notes

- Redux is not a monolithic library, it is more of a practice, and some helping functions around this practice.
- [You might not need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367), unless you are dealing with large set of data, which frequently needs to change.
- It is very easy to write your own implementation of redux helpers, see the tutorials by Dan Abramov(creator of Redux)
- Apart from three basic principals, it DOESN'T have any strong opinion about:
  - how you should organize your source files
  - where to put your actions or reducer
  - which middlewares to use
  - which UI library to use it with
  - how to implement immutability

Following two free courses on Egghead.io are very very recommended if you are serious about Redux:

- [Dan Abramov: Egghead.io: Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)  
- [Dan Abramov: Egghead.io: Building React applications with idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux)
